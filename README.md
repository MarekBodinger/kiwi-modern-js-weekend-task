# kiwi-modern-js-weekend-task

My implementation of 2018's [Kiwi.com Modern JS weekend](https://jsweekend.cz/) task.

 - 👁️ [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) components.
 - 📅 Date utilities handled by [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).
 - ✏️ Code is separated to components and services parts.
 - ➕ Recommendations bonus task implemented.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
